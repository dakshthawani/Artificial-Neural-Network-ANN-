# Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

A simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) implementation in Python for approximating the sine function.

## Description
This project demonstrates a basic ANN architecture with one hidden layer to approximate the sine function. The ANN is trained using a dataset generated from the sine function, and its performance is evaluated on a validation set.

## Tech Stack
- **Python** (Programming Language)
- **NumPy** (Numerical Computing Library)
- **Pandas** (Data Manipulation Library)
- **Matplotlib** (Data Visualization Library)

## Features
- Generation of a dataset from the sine function.
- Implementation of a basic ANN architecture with one hidden layer.
- Training of the ANN using a randomly sampled dataset.
- Evaluation of the ANN's performance on a validation set.
- Visualization of the validation results.

## How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ann-sine-approximation.git
2. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
3. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python ann_sine_approximation.py
   
## How to Use the Project
- The script will generate a dataset from the sine function and train the ANN.
- The ANN's performance will be evaluated on a validation set and visualized using a scatter plot.
